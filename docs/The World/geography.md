# Geography

The world as we know it is not an infinite expanse of land and water. It is a finite space, with many boundaries and borders that define the limits of different regions. These regions are known as continents, countries, states, provinces, cities, and towns.

There is no part of the world that has not been explored or mapped. Every inch of the Earth is surveyed, photographed and documented. However, human beings do not live everywhere, as some parts of the world can be hard to inhabit.

## Continents

The Earth can be divided into a couple of separate landmasses, known as continents. There are roughly seven such major landmasses, each with its own unique geography, climate, and culture.

### Africa

Africa is the second-largest continent on Earth, after Asia. It is home to a diverse range of cultures, languages, and peoples. The continent is known for its vast deserts, dense rainforests, and savannas.
